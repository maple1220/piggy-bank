# June 26: Day 1

I took inspiration from the panda stealing piggy bank thing to remake it into my own personlized version of it. It's also lost 

and I've been mourning about it for years so why not make it!

Decided to starting on the CAD, I was thinking of ways of how I can attach the walls of the box easily and went with a triangle slot method (unsure of the name) I finished the base and sides of the of the box with many many redos

**3 hours**

# June 28: Day 2

I almost went insane. The walls wouldn't fit together and I realized I needed to add some tolerance for the triangle parts incase anything happens with the printing process and to reduce less friction. Spent 2 hours readjusting everything.
